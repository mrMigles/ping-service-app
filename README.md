# Ping Service
http://t.me/pingYourAppBot

This application allows you to ping your web apps to avoid them falling asleep.
It can be useful when you use cloud platforms with restricted live times for applications (like Heroku Free or Openshift).

Ping Service provides two options to manage your tasks:
* Web interface
* Telegram Bot Interface
